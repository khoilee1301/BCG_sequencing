# BCG Sequencing
---

The Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine was originally developed to prevent tuberculosis; however, it is now well established as a treatment for bladder cancer and is being actively investigated for neurological and autoimmune diseases. In the Faustman Lab, we currently use the Japan BCG strain in clinical trials for type 1 diabetes (T1D). Our studies have shown that BCG can reduce blood glucose levels to near-normal ranges and reprogram glucose metabolism in lymphocytes.
